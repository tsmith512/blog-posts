    <p>
      I'm a CSPO digital product manager and web developer with a design
      background. I lead teams by advocating for your business objectives and
      your usersâ€™ needs. I love beautiful typography, efficient code, and
      helping teams distill their ideas into actionable goals. Currently, I'm
      looking for product manager roles to build tools that help people work
      smarter.
