  <h1>I'm Taylor Smith</h1>

    <!-- @TODO: Taken from current site. Way too long. Who am I talking to? -->
    As a product owner with a background in web development and an education in
    graphic design, I can efficiently lead a team by advocating for your
    business objectives and your users’ needs. I love responsive design,
    beautiful typography, efficient code, and helping clients distill their
    needs into actionable ideas. I’m an Austin, Texas native who also spends a
    lot of time in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
