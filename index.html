    <p>
      I'm a CSPO digital product manager and web developer with a design
      background. I lead teams by advocating for your business objectives and
      your usersâ€™ needs. I love beautiful typography, efficient code, and
      helping teams distill their ideas into actionable goals. I'm also a
      hobbyist photographer and theatrical stage manager. Currently, I'm ramping
      up at <a href="https://www.verypossible.com">Very</a>, a technology
      partner that provides expert product development, software engineering,
      and design services.
