# What I learned about working with people, as a remote employee.

When 2013 ended, I'd worked for Four Kitchens in Austin for a little over a
year, working primarily in-town and on-site. And I needed a change of scenery.
We had hired our first full-time remote employee over the summer, so I asked
if I would be allowed to go remote.

Now, in 2015, I doubt this would even be a major question at 4K, thankfully. But
at the time, it was intimating. Would a personal request to skip town end up
trashing me professionally? As it happened: not at all. And I learned a few
things about working with people along the way.

## Inclusion means equal suffering

When one person is working remotely, it's easy to want to dial her in on that
conference phone no one knows how to use and have everyone else circle around
the table. That's a horrible experience for everyone: she can't hear what's
going on and everyone else forgets about her. Dump the Polycom, I don't care how
great you think it is.

Instead, whenever possible, put everyone on the same level: if one person is on
video chat, everyone uses video chat. Even if you are in the same office! If one
person has to use the phone, try going audio-only for everyone. If someone is
stuck at the airport and can only use text-chat, see what happens when you
_join him_ instead of _excluding him._

When everyone works with the same limitations on their communications, they
communicate more openly with everyone in the group instead of just those that
have the highest fidelity presence. As teams get accustomed to this, efficiency
returns as they learn to cooperate in new ways.

### Ways to make this work:

- **Never make someone feel like it is a bother** to open a channel of
  communication with you; that hinders cooperation. We've leaned heavily toward
  products which minimize the time needed to open a meeting or conversation:
- **Video Conferencing Products**
  - We use **[Zoom Meetings][ZOOM]** at 4K, and I recommend it highly. Up to **HOW
    MANY** participants on Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, and Windows Phone. We
    found the quality to be very high and the pricing to be affordable.
    Screensharing tools are fantastic.
  - **[Google Hangouts][HANG]** works decently for up to **HOW MANY** people,
    but the quality isn't fantastic and you have to deal with Google+ to make it
    work. It's free, though, and has tight integration with Google Calendar for
    simple invites. Features like fake backgrounds; masks, hats, and goofy
    eyewear overlays; and sound effects help inject some comic relief, too.
  - **[GoToMeeting][GTM]** wasn't everyone's favorite, but it had the best
    experience when needing to integrate with phone-only callers. It's more
    expensive than Zoom and moderately more difficult to initiate a meeting.
- **Video Conferencing Usage Strategies**
  - _Everyone sits at their own computer_
    if you haven't hit a participant or bandwidth limitation.
  - _If you need to reduce the meeting participants,_ have people:
    - Split into multiple conference rooms!
      Even two rooms of eight plus one caller is a vastly better experience than
      one room of sixteen plus one caller.
    - Pair up with a buddy!
      It's surprising, actually: remote participants with their own computers
      will actually have a stronger presence than two or three people sharing
      a single machine. Watch the shift in participant dynamics.
  - _Everyone must wear a headset_
    I hated this at first, but it reduces noise and clarifies voices tremendously.
    Also, Apple had the genius idea to put the webcam mic underneath the keyboard,
    so if anyone on a Mac starts typing, it sounds like an earthquake.
    - I love my [Logitech Gaming Headset G330][LGH]
    - I also use the same [Plantronics M165][PM] Bluetooth headset you use with your phone
    - Avoid dangling mics (mics that are on the headphone cable), everyone can
      hear every movement they make
  - _Encourage everyone to be disciplined with the mute function!_
- **Audio Conferencing**
  - Use any of the above and have people disable their video.
  - Avoid sharing phones or conference lines, it gets really noisy.
  - Many cell phones offer three-way calling, even if the hype on that feature
    died a long time ago. For very small groups, it is viable.
- **Text Chat Tips**
  - There are too many good tools here to list, but 4K uses [HipChat][HC] and
    sometimes [Slack][SL].
  - _Requirements for your text chat product:_
    - Easy to leave running all day
    - Easy to see notifications for important things like direct messages,
      mentions, and alerts in important rooms
    - Easy to ignore notifications for unimportant things like ongoing
      conversations in general rooms, rooms you've left, or other noise that
      should not interrupt
    - Backscroll and history searching
    - Mobile applications, though they should be easy to disable
    - Support for integrations and link/oEmbed previews is great
  - _Usage strategies:_
    - _Project or Team specific rooms_
    - _Open a watercooler:_
      Remote employees miss "hallway" conversation, so open a general purpose
      room for office-wide banter and conversation. Lots of discovery and
      idea exchanges will happen here.
    - _Encourage people to be responsive:_
      If a remote employee cannot get in touch with her project manager using
      the preferred chat program because he isn't responsive to it, you're going
      to have a problem.
    - _Give your tools a voice:_
      - Integrate with JIRA so it can tell a room that a story was updated
      - Integrate with GitHub so it can tell a room that a PR or issue was opened
      - Integrate with Twitter so it can tell your watercooler room when someone
        mentions your company on Twitter.
      - People who like [IFTTT][] or [Zapier][Z] will love doing this.
    - _Update your status:_
      That's right, AIM status messages from the 90s are coming back. Let people
      know why now is a good or bad time to reach you. Ideas include:
      - WF ("Working From") updates like "WFHome", "WFCoffeeshop"
      - On a Call / In a Meeting
      - Focus time
      - Lunch
      - Vacation / Holiday
- **Never stop trying, be dedicated to the process**
  - It feels weird and deeply silly at first, stick with it and it'll become
    second nature.

## Promote travel

Over time, your team will get better at working remotely and it will be a
freeing, empowering observation. But face-to-face time is still important.
Encourage your team to:

- _Meet on uncommon ground:_
  Send a mix of remote and on-site team members to events where everyone is a guest.
- _Bring the troops home:_
  Periodically, host all-hands-in-house days or weeks. It's refreshing,
  surprisingly fun, and a great time to capitalize on strength in numbers to
  power through a code sprint.
- _You have friends everywhere:_
  Go visit them, work together in their environments, and see a new town like a local.

## "Be nice" becomes "Communicate empathetically"

- Written communication isn't always _read_ how you would have _said_ it.
- Be aware of the hearts and minds of your team. In person, it's easier to
  know when someone has had a rough day.
- Approach humor and sarcasm gently. When stress increases, avoid both, and
  wait a while on the send button.
- If there's a long back-and-forth discussion over email, text chat, or comments
  in a tool, whether it starts to get heated or not: **change the channel.**
  You have video chat, use it for diffusion.
- Even more so than in person, negative emotions are supremely contagious.
- Know when to send your teammate a picture of a puppy and call a timeout.
- Know when to apologize.

## Be an overt goofball sometimes.

Human interaction is satisfying to many people, and it is largely lost to remote
employees. Combine that with a tense project and misery ensures. We combat this
in a number of ways, to bring each other a smile. It's more important than most
realize.
