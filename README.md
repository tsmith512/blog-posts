# What I learned about working with people, as a remote employee.

When 2013 ended, I'd worked for Four Kitchens in Austin for a little over a
year, working primarily in-town and on-site. And I needed a change of scenery.
We had hired our first full-time remote employee over the summer, so I asked
if I would be allowed to go remote.

That was 2013, this is 2015. Now, I doubt this would even be a major question
at 4K, thankfully. But at the time, it was scary. Would a personal request to
skip town end up trashing me professionally? TL;DR: Nope. But I learned a few
things about working with people.

## Inclusion means equal suffering in lackluster telecommunication technology

You know the most hated thing in your office aside from the microwave that blows
everything up? It's that conference phone no one knows how to use (dude, dial
9 for the outside line, then the long distance access password). So when one
person is working remotely, it's easy to want to just dial that person in and
everyone else circles around conference table. That's a horrible experience for
everyone: Mr. Remoter can't hear what's going on, everyone else forgets about
him.

Instead, whenever possible, put everyone on the same level: if one person is on
video chat, everyone uses video chat. If one person has to use the phone, it's
audio-only for everyone. Ms. Traveler can only get chat working at the airport?
Join _her_.

When everyone works with the same limitations on their communications, they
communicate more openly with everyone in the group, instead of just those that
have the most realistic presence.

### Ways to make this work:

- **Video Conferencing Products**
  - We use **[Zoom Meetings][ZOOM]** at 4K, and I recommend it highly. Up to **HOW
    MANY** participants on Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, and Windows Phone. We
    found the quality to be very high and the pricing to be affordable.
    Screensharing tools are fantastic.
  - **[Google Hangouts][HANG]** works decently for up to **HOW MANY** people,
    but the quality isn't fantastic and you have to deal with Google+ to make it
    work. It's free, though, and has tight integration with Google Calendar for
    simple invites. Features like fake backgrounds; masks, hats, and goofy
    eyewear overlays; and sound effects help inject some comic relief, too.
  - **[GoToMeeting][GTM]** wasn't everyone's favorite, but it had the best
    experience when needing to integrate with phone-only callers. It's more
    expensive than Zoom and moderately more difficult to initiate a meeting.
- **Video Conferencing Tips**
  - _Everyone sits at their own computer_
    if you haven't hit a participant or bandwidth limitation.
  - _If you need to reduce the meeting participants,_ have people:
    - Split into multiple conference rooms!
      Even two rooms of eight plus one caller is a vastly better experience than
      one room of sixteen plus one caller.
    - Pair up with a buddy!
      It's surprising, actually: remote participants with their own computers
      will actually have a stronger presence than two or three people sharing
      a single machine. Watch the shift in participant dynamics.
  - _Everyone must wear a headset_
    I hated this at first, but it reduces noise tremendously. Also, Apple had
    the genius idea to put the webcam mic underneath the keyboard, so if anyone
    on a Mac starts typing, it sounds like an earthquake.
    - I love my [Logitech Gaming Headset G330][LGH]
    - Use the same Bluetooth headset you use with your phone
    - Avoid dangling mics (mics that are on the headphone cable), everyone can
      hear every movement they make
  - _Encourage everyone to be disciplined with the mute function!_
- **Audio Conferencing**
  - Use any of the above and have people disable their video.
  - Avoid sharing phones or conference lines, it gets really noisy
