# Email is killing me, I'll use JavaScript and Searching

We here at [Four Kitchens](http://www.fourkitchens.com) do love us some email. Last week, I self-awarded a prize for having achieved 4,000 unread items in my inbox, with 2,000 read items (that's 7 emails I haven't addressed per day of my employment). I could keep going for the record, but I thought I'd attempt to use nerdiness to take better control.

If you're in inbox ninja, skip directly to {{SCRIPTING SECTION}}.
